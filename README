== What it is?

This is a very simple Rails 3 sample application that demonstrates
how to use MongoMapper and play with the MongoDB database engine.

There are 2 models: Book and Author. I just wanted to demonstrate how
to do associations ala ActiveRecord

== Requirements

=== MongoDB: 

Install the MongoDB (server and client) for your platform
http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

=== Gems: mongo, MongoMapper and bson_ext

bundle install should get you going
